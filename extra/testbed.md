#some players play in more games/innings than others. Using inning since that's
#the lowest division of game participation we have. None of the stats quite take
#play time into account the way we want. UZR150, the only one that directly 
#accounts for play time, is a player's average/expected UZR over 150 games. It's
#useful for comparing two players to eachother, but what we care about is 
#overall team performance.
