Statistical study of baseball (also known as Sabermetrics or
SABRmetrics) has become an increasingly popular tool both for fans
seeking to understand the game and for organizations seeking to optimize
their rosters and build better teams. Our group will look at how
effectively different measurements for evaluating individual player
performance predict team success.

The datasets used come from two main sources
[retrosheet.org](retrosheet.org) and [fangraphs.com](fangraphs.com), we
constrict our sample size to the years 1998-2019 for two main reasons.
The 30 team MLB format only started in 1998 and by then most teams had
their data recorded electronically so data is more available and
reliable. The 2020 season is discarded since, it was started late and
only 60 games were played which much less than the usual amount of
matches in a season.

The data from [fangraphs.com](fangraphs.com) had to be web scraped,
which was a painful process of trial error and error handling. Whereas,
the retrosheet data was conviently put in dataset by the Chadwick
bureau.

We looked at different variables (OBP, OPS, wOBA, wRC, wRAA, UZR, DEF,
etc.) which are most commonly used in SABRmetrics and looked at the
relationship with win rate, we analysed the residual vs. fitted plots
and looked at how good each of the variables at predicting.
