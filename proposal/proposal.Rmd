## 1. Introduction

The use of data science techniques to study player performance is called ["Sabermetrics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics). It's used by professionals within the industry to make decisions regarding team roster changes and by amateurs interested in studying the game (or betting on outcomes).


There is no shortage of data for sabermetrics; there is more data than anyone could ever pour through on everything from player stats to the play-by-play of every US professional game from the past hundred years.

There are a few sources we can go for. However, [Retrosheet](retrosheet.org) seems like our best place. Itâ€™s the result of a small army of volunteers, combing historical sources to try to re-create the play-by-play of every game in baseball history and digitizing it for download and analysis.

# 2. Data

For example, this the dataset for the game log for the 2019 which you can download from [here](https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html).

## 3. Data analysis plan

We are interested in looking at a sampling of some of the most studied offensive and defensive statistics (RBI, OBP, OPS, wOBA, wRC, wRAA, OAA, Catch Probability, DRS, UZR, etc.). We could compare each team's postseason roster from 2020 and see how well each of these stats predicted a team's success in the postseason. 

If we've got extra time we could run the process for a few different seasons. Conversely, if it's too much work we might consider cutting defensive stats since they seem like they might be a hassle to calculate.
